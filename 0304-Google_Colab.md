Google Colabratory is a jupyterhub solution provided by Google. Many of the class projects may want to use colab as a way to share notebooks with your sponsors.  Today we will make our jupyter tutorials compatible with Google colab (If possible).  

## Agenda (80 Minutes)

- (30 minutes) Modify for use with Google Colab
- (50 minutes) Tutorial exchange

# Modify for use with Google Colab

Today we will revisit our tutorials yet again.  This time we want to make them compatible with Google Colab which uses a Virtual Machine (VM).  The nice thing about this setup is that you will have full administrator rights to install anything you want on the VM. The annoying thing about this setup is that you will need to install the software every time you run a notebook.  

- Rewrite the notebooks to include any installation requirements at the beginning of the notebook. 
- See if you can add the ![Open in Colab button](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/84f0493939e0c4de4e6dbe113251b4bfb5353e57134ffd9fcab6b8714514d4d1/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667) button to your notebook

Finish your modifications and submit it to the class github repository as a pull request.  Your instructors will accept the pull request blindly (DO NOT BREAK THE BUILD).  Use the remainder of the time today to try out the other tutorials in Google Colab and make a plan for working on your projects over spring break.
