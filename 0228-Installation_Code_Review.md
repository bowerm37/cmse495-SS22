# Install Instruction Reviews

This is a team paring exercise.  Your team will work with another team to review your projects unit tests. Combine your teams and split up in to two groups (some people from each team).  Have one group review your team's install instructions and the other group review the other team's install instructions. You can decide how best to share your instruction code.  **_Make sure not to violate any NDA_**

## Agenda

- (5 minutes) Break up into two groups 
- (5 minutes) Quick Introductions. Identify a timekeeper, notetaker, code reviewer, and facilitator.
- (20 minutes) Code installation and unit testing review
- (10 minutes) Discussion and brainstorming about improvements 
- (10 minutes) Finish typing up email to instructors

In your group, have someone that is not from the code development team to try to install the software and run the unit tests. Have the group members from the development team hold back and only give advice and support if there is a problem.  The idea is to streamline the process so that the documentation and instructions are sufficient for someone outside of the development team to be able to install, test and use the software without needing to have a developer to help.   As a group take lots of notes and review the unit tests and documentation to the development group some constructive feedback.  If you are a member of the code's development team, use this as an opportunity to fix problems as they are discovered. 

As a group, prepare a report for the instructor and the development team. This report should provide the following:

- Clearly label which teams code is being evaluated.
- List of the evaluation group members with an indication about which capstone team they are on and their roles in the meeting.
- Was someone outside the development team able to install the software and get the unit tests working?  If not, what was the problem?
- Briefly describe the completeness of the install instructions. Was the review team able to identify any missing steps.
- Is there anything that needed to be added to the documentation to make the project easier to install and test?
- Was there anything you could add to the project to help make the project better?

This is a group effort, email the report to the instructors and cc the other members of the code development team.
