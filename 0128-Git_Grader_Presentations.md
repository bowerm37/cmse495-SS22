# In-Class Assignment: Git Log Data Collection


## Agenda (80 Minutes)

- (30 minutes) Finish up git grader
- (30 minutes) Git grader presentations
- (20 minutes) Project Plan work time

# 1. Finish Git Grader

Get back into your groups and finish the git grader project. Both team A and team B will be given 15 minutes to do a presentation (and demo). The project management sub-team will be in charge of the demo (they may want to delegate this to a team that gets done early so they have more time to put things together).  

# 2. Git Grader Presentations

Team A and Team B will be given at most 15 minutes to present their problem and their solution. Make sure you include the following:

- Does the project work?
- What went well
- What didn't go well
- What will you learn from next time?

# 3. Project Plan Work time
Use the rest of the time to finish up your project plan which is due Sunday.
