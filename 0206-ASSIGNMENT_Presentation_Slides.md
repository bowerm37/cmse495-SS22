# 1. Presentation Planning

Step one is to plan what you want your presentation will include.  Most people use slide shows (PowerPoint, Google slides, etc.) to plan what they are going to say and the order they will say it in.  This is a good first step. Even if you are planning to turn in a final video, use the slides as a form of "[storyboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)" for your video to know what parts you want to include and what you don't want to include. 

Prepare the presentation for a general audience.  make something that you could show in in-coming data science student (or a family member) to get them excited about the project. Also remember that your sponsor will be watching this presntation so think of this as an opportunity to "Wow" them. 

Some things to consider for your presentation:

- All members of the group should talk.
- Breifly introduce the members of the group.
- Describe your overal goals of the project.
- Describe how the work will be broken up and solved.
- Describe the expected successful outcomes. 
- Do not exseed the 10 minute talk length.


However, I really want to see creativity.  Think outside of slides and talking. You have the opportunity to show a demonstration of your code, include some animated results.  

Let your instructor know what you are thinking, we may be able to show you some easy to use tools to produce your vision.
