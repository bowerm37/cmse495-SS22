# 1. First Contact D2L Quiz

Please log onto D2L and complete the quick quiz in the content section.  As mentioned in the previous class this quiz is part of a research project. Your grade on the quiz will have zero impact on your grade in the class.  

I just ask that you try your best.

# 2. NDA/IP Discussion

We will try to find time to answer questions you may have about the NDA and IP agreements associated with the projects.

# 3. Finalize Project Reports

Please spend the next 35 minutes in your breakout rooms, finishing your reports from Wednesday.

# 4. Sharing Review results

Each group will get about 5 minutes to share some details about the project they reviewed. These details must be emailed to your project instructor who will share with the students assigned to the project next week. The email must include the name of the project, the list of individuals who reviewed the project and any insights they would like to share with the team that will be assigned the project.
