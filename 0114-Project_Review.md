##### Project Review Presentations

Today we will break up into groups and review the project proposals and try to understand what will be needed to complete the project.  


## Agenda (80 Minutes)

- (15 minutes) NDA/IP questions and answers
- (10 minutes) Finalize Project Reports
- (30 minutes) Sharing review results
- (5 minutes) break
- (20 minutes) Finish sharing review projects.


# NDA/IP Discussion

We will try to find time to answer questions you may have about the NDA and IP agreements associated with the projects. 

# Sharing Review results

Each group will get about 5 minutes to share some details about the project they reviewed. These details must be emailed to your project instructor who will share with the students assigned to the project next week. The email must include the name of the project, the list of individuals who reviewed the project and any insights they would like to share with the team that will be assigned the project.
