# 1. Team Assignments

By now you should have received an email from your instructor with your assigned project and team names/emails. I have given each team a number. We will use the zoom breakout room feature to get into your teams.  

### NDA Signatures

If your project requires an NDA or IP agreement. Please make a copy of the PDF form for your project and sign the agreements NOW. The form that is required can be found in the project description for your project.  Upload your signed documents to the Secure Assignment folder on D2L.
