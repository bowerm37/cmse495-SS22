# Finish Tutorial

Finish your tutorial and submit it to the class github repository as a pull request.  Your instructors will accept the pull request blindly (DO NOT BREAK THE BUILD).  Once your team has successfully submitted their tutorial you will be pared with another team to review each other's notebooks. 

This will be first come first serve.

# Tutorial Presentations

Review your partner team's tutorial and provide feedback in the form of either an issue on the github issues page and/or a pull request.
