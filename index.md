# CMSE 495 - Data Science Capstone (Spring 2022)

The CMSE 495 data science capstone course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to put together what they have learned across multiple courses to develop a final project that demonstrates their ability to work in a team on real-world problems.

The capstone course has three major goals:
1. Provide students with a high impact, end-to-end project experience where they can apply classroom experiences and data science skills to solve real-world problems. 
2. Provide students with opportunities to learn and practice professional skills (communication, teamwork and leadership) in the context of team-based projects.
3. Provide opportunities for students and faculty in the department to build relationships and network with industry partners, community organizations, and campus colleagues. 

**_<font color="red">NOTE:  This course will be pivoting to a fully on-line modality during the first 3 weeks of spring semester 2022 in response to the rapidly rising COVID infection rates.  The current plan is hold class via zoom over the first three weeks and to be back in-person starting Monday January 31st. However, this plan will be updated as we get closer to the date and more information is available.</font>_**

## Team Projects
The course instructor (Dr. Dirk Colbry <colbrydi@msu.edu>) is seeking  out high-impact projects sponsored by an external "project sponsor" who will work with a student team to solve problems that make an economic, social and/or research contribution. We expect to solicit project sponsors from three areas: industry (with a slight focus on Companies in Michigan), government, community organizations, and research. 

For more information on becoming a project sponsor please see our [Project Sponsor Flyer](CMSE495_Project_Sponsor_Flyer.pdf)

Projects will focus on the broad goal of "stories told by data" and fall somewhere in the standard data analysis pipeline:

## Course Structure
The class will meet three times a week during the 15-week semester. Classroom time will be divided across three broad activity categories:

- Project planning, team meetings, and reports
- Professional skills training
- Software development and technical skills training

When possible, the majority of time outside of class will be dedicated to tasks and deliverables that relate directly to the capstone teams’ projects.  

Additional information will be added to this website as we get closer to the start of class in the spring...
