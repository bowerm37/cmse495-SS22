# CATME team review

When you get to class, log onto CATME and provide a review of you and your team's performace on the slide development milestone.

# Project Similarities

Your instructor wants to do an experiment.  Let's take some time try to understand each other's projects and figure out how they are similar and they are different. This will be a individual judgement call but may be based on information such as:

- Similar language Used in the project
- Similar libraries and software you plan to use
- Similar Data used in projects (Text, Time, image, etc.)
- Similar modeling techniques
- Similar project sponsors
- etc. 

To make things easer we will identify and share project attributes.  For this exercise we will use the following shared document to keep track of notes:

First, use the QUESTIONS section to write down some simple questions that you and the other teams can answer to help align your projects. 

Second, under your team name, start answering some of the questions.  


Once you have a good feel about the projects, fill out the following distance matrix as best you can.  Start with your project and assign the value of zero (0) then rank all of the remaining projects on a scale of 1-9 with 1 being the most similar and 9 being the least similar.  This is a personal perception of the project (don't just copy a teammates).
