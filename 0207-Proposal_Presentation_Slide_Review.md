When you get to class, log onto CATME and provide a review of you and your team's performace on the slide development milestone.

# Next Week! Proposal Presentations

Next you will be giving your proposal presentations.  You have all week to practice the presentation and present it to the group on the following Monday.  This is one of three major presentations this semester.  Make sure you practice! You will be given 5-10 minutes for your presentation. Use the time wisely.

Teams have the option of recording and editing their presentation ahead of time.  This is highly recommended but not required.  Please let your instructor know ahead of time if you plan on recording and send them your final link. 

If you are going live or recorded you still need to be up in front of the room and ready for questions.
