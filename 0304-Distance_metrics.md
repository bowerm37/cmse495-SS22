# Distance Metrics

**_WARNING_**: You only have 30 minutes to see what you come up with for this project.  Come up with a plan. Split up the work and use your time wisely.  I challenge the teams to come up with creative solutions.

Each team will break-up into their groups and fork the following git repository:

[https://github.com/colbrydi/CMSE495_2022_Distance_Measures](https://github.com/colbrydi/CMSE495_2022_Distance_Measures)

In the repository, create a jupyter notebook to analyze the data provided in the csv file.  This notebook should be written as a report explaining how the data is analyzed and showing how the data specifically relates to your teams perception of the project relative to the rest of the class (Feel Free to use the provided template).  Your group needs to do the following:

1. Read in the data provided by the csv file (this is the data from our survey taken on [0207-Proposal_Presentation_Slide_Review][0207-Proposal_Presentation_Slide_Review].
2. Analyze the data to figure out what it says about your teams project.
3. Write your report and submit it as a pull request (make sure you use a unique filename to avoid merge collisions). 


**_RECOMMENDED_**: Generate a a square "average distance matrix" where both the rows and columns are the group names.  Each row is the teams average distance to the projects represented in the columns. If done correctly the value across the diagonal will be zero (because each team's project is zero distance from their own project). 


# Report Summaries

Each team will have 5 minutes to report what they learned in their 30 minutes.
