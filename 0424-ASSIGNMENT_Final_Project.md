The final project and all of it's milestone components are due on the last day of class.  If you have any questions about content and/or format please review the [submission guildlines for the journal of open source software](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html).   Please double check all of the project assignments.


All projects should follow the same basic structure laid out at the beginning of the semester. File and folder naming is important.  Use meaningful names as described in class.
