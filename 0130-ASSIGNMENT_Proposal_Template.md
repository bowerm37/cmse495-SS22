# Instructions

Please write your proposals either in full markdown files (md) or as Jupyter notebooks (ipynb).  This notebook not only acts as instructions/outline for your proposal but should be used as a template for writing. Rename the file to something like ```proposal.md``` or ```proposal.ipynb``` and commit it to your ```docs``` folder.  **_DO NOT leave the instructions in your submitted document_**. Erase all instructions and only leave the basic structure and format. Try to write the proposal to a general audience that may be interested (for example your classmates, your advisor or your lab mates).  

Make this look as professional as possible. You will be sending this to your project sponsors.
