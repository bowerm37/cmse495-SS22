Please write your proposals either in full markdown files (md) or as Jupyter notebooks (ipynb).  This notebook not only acts as instructions/outline for your proposal but should be used as a template for writing. Rename the file to something like ```proposal.md``` or ```proposal.ipynb``` and commit it to your ```docs``` folder.  **_DO NOT leave the instructions in your submitted document**. Erase all instructions and only leave the basic structure and format. Try to write the proposal to a general audience that may be interested (for example your classmates, your advisor or your lab mates).
