# Quick Group meeting

Today in class you will be giving a quick status update for your project.  Take no more than 10 minutes to meet with your group and organize your thoughts (someone may want to create a shared document to take notes).  Your status update should be no more than 5 minutes and include the following:

- What progress have you made?
- What open loops do you still need to close?
- Where could you use some help?
- Shout-outs to people that have been a help to your project.

# Outreach showcase and Team Reports

As a class we are going to review the slides generated by the teams.  The instructor will put up a slide and each team will give their report.
