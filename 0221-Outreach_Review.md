# Outreach Reviews

As a class we are going to review the slides and news articles of our peers.

# Code Reviews

This is a team paring exercise.  Your team will work with another team to review your projects and provide feedback. Combine your teams and split up in to two groups (some people from each team).  Have one group review your teams unit tests and the other group review the other teams unit test. 

## Agenda

- (5 minutes) Break up into two groups 
- (5 minutes) Quick Introductions. Identify a timekeeper, notetaker, code reviewer, and facilitator.
- (20 minutes) Code installation and documentation review
- (10 minutes) Discussion and brainstorming about improvements
- (10 minutes) Finish typing up email to instructors

In your group, have someone that is not from the code development team to try to install the software and review any documentation. Have the group members from the development team hold back and only give advice and support if there is a problem.  The idea is to streamline the process so that the documentation and instructions are sufficient for someone outside of the development team to be able to install and review the software without needing to have a developer to help.   As a group take lots of notes and review the documentation to the development group some constructive feedback.  If you are a member of the code's development team, use this as an opportunity to fix problems as they are discovered. 

As a group, prepare a report for the instructor and the development team. This report should provide the following:

- List of the evaluation group members with an indication about which capstone team they are on.
- Was someone outside the development team able to install the software and understand the documentation?  If not, what was the problem?
- What are the open loops still on the project?
- Is there anything that needed to be added to the documentation to make the project easier to understand?
- Was there anything you could add to the project to help make the project better?

This is a group effort, email the report to the instructors and cc the other members of the code development team.
